# GUI-Encrypt-Decrypt

This is a python file that can encrypt or decrypt all the files on a specific folder.
To do this I fist created encrypt.py and decrypt.py files based on a youtube video.

Then I created main.py file and I coded the GUI part of the program using tkinter.
Later I added the functions to be able to encrypt and decrypt files.
